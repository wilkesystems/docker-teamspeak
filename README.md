## Base Image for Teamspeak

TeamSpeak is proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software for audio 
communication between users on a chat channel, much like a telephone conference call. 
Users typically use headphones with a microphone. The client software connects to a 
TeamSpeak server of the user's choice, from which the user may join chat channels.

The target audience for TeamSpeak is gamers, who can use the software to communicate 
with other players on the same team of a multiplayer game. Communicating by voice gives 
a competitive advantage by enabling players to keep their hands on the controls.
